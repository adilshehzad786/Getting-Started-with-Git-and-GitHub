Update base branch without **new** commits!

Note:
If you want to incorporate new changes from the base branch
- normally need to make a new commit with a merge
- however, this makes history messy **very** quickly
- to incorporate updates from your _base_ branch, you need to rebase

This is the type of thing that seems unnecessary until you have to do it
- great for projects where everyone works _quickly_
