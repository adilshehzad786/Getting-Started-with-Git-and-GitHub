## Advanced `git`

Note:
These concepts are **especially** hard to grasp without hand's on experience

- often they don't make sense until you _really_ need them
- don't worry if you are lost
    - ask lots of questions
    - practice and experience will make them stick
    - try to just get a general feel
- take note of each command's
    - purpose
    - pitfalls
