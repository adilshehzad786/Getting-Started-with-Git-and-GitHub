Write in present tense, imperative mood
<small><ul>
    <li>`Add README with title and summary`</li>
    <li>`Rewrite presentation section on commit messages`</li>
</ul></small>

<small class="fragment">Commits should sound like commands</small>

Note:
- imperative mood - as if you are telling someone to do something
- present tense, as if you are currently doing the change
- **this makes short messages**, but does sound rude at first
