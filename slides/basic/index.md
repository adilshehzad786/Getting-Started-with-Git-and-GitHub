# Basic `git`

Note:
Before we _really_ begin I'd like to point out that:

- it's **really** hard to understand these concepts the first time around
- they require hands-on experience to _really_ sink in
- the best way to learn is just through experience

**I _will_ do the best I can**

- it will not be perfect
- don't worry too much if you walk away a bit confused
- ask _lots_ of questions
- check back against documentation often
