**Step-by-step**

1. `mkdir [folder]` - make a new folder
2. `cd [folder]` - enter the folder
3. `git init` - make the folder a repo

Note:
1. make a new folder which will be our git repository
2. enter the folder to make it the current folder
3. initialize the repository in the current folder

The current folder is now a git repository and will allow you to track versions
